This code implements an adaptive kernel regression guided parametric t-SNE for multimodal embeddings mapping.
The regression.ipynb shows how to use the code to train a projection and mapping model and draw a static projection map.
For the fully interactive features, we have another notebook Contour_mapping_interactive.ipynb which we only tested on colab.

You need the precomputed embeddings to test the code.
We provide the precomputed HPSv2 embeddings on HPD here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1skItPzWBaSssmOr8kWo9Zda-7yAIznea?usp=sharing
